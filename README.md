- Introduction
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. This repository explores key techniques in machine learning, particularly supervised and unsupervised learning, vectorization, and gradient descent.

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs, and this learned mapping is then used to predict outputs for new, unseen data.

Examples of supervised learning algorithms include:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with datasets that have no labels. The model tries to find patterns and relationships within the data. This is often used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association tasks.

Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include:

- K-Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Hierarchical Clustering
Autoencoders
Vectorization
Vectorization is the process of converting data (like text or images) into numerical vectors that can be used in machine learning models. Efficient vectorization is crucial for handling large datasets and speeding up the learning process. In this repository, youâ€™ll find examples of:

Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
One-hot encoding
Feature scaling and normalization
Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the model parameters (weights and biases) to find the best fit for the training data.

Key concepts in gradient descent include:

Learning Rate: Determines the size of the steps taken towards the minimum.
Batch Gradient Descent: Uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Uses a single training example per iteration.
Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Uses a subset of the data per iteration.
Gradient descent is a foundational algorithm in training models, especially in deep learning and neural networks.
